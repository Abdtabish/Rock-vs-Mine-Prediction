# Mine vs Rock Classification 🪨💣

This project builds a **binary classification model** to distinguish between **mines** and **rocks** using sonar signal data.  
The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook using **Logistic Regression** from scikit-learn.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Sonar signals are reflected differently by metal objects (mines) and natural rocks.  
This project applies **machine learning** to classify these objects based on numeric sonar features.

**Key steps in the notebook:**
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Preprocess data using NumPy and Pandas
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train a Logistic Regression model
5. Evaluate model accuracy
